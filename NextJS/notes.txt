2. What is React Server Component? (RSC)
Ans: React Server Component is a new Architecture introduced by React Team in version 18 which was quickly embraced by Next.js
The architecture introduces a new way of creating React components, splitting them into two types:
- Server Component
  : In Next.js all the components are Server Component by default
  : They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database
  : However, they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions
- Client Component
  : To create a CLient Component, it's necessary to add 'use client' at the top of the component file
  : Client component can;t perform tasks like reading the files but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interaction.

3. Routing:
- Next.js has file-system based routing mechanism (Imp)
- URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase.
